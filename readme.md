Advice for the children to run this repo on linux (or blessed WSL):

1 - Install compilers for C and C++
sudo apt-get install gcc 
sudo apt-get install g++ 

2 - Compile code
gcc hello.c -> creates a.out
g++ hello.cpp -> creates a.out by default
note: the a stands for assembled. Its an executable file you can run natively on your OS.

3 - Run the code
./a.out


4 - You can also name the file. Example
g++ -o hello hello.cpp
./hello
